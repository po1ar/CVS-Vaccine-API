# CVS Vaccine Bypass API

## Python Based API that bypasses the CVS Vaccine availability block. Everyone should be able to see what cities have the vaccine available.

### Partnering with [@kilianalias](https://github.com/kilianalias), we built this open source API to let people check what cities have the vaccine at their local CVS. 

### This is open source so do as you please, but let us know what you guys do make of it.

*Built with python & flask.*
